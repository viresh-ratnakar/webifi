- Use the renamed command name (type, not enter).

### Version: Webifi v0.02, May 9, 2022

### Unnumbered bug-fix, May 3, 2022

- Bug-fix: HTML tags have to be removed from clues before showing them.

### Unnumbered bug-fix, May 3, 2022

### Unnumbered tweak, May 3, 2022

- More doc tweaking.
- Add "navigate" as a synonym command for "best"

### Version: Webifi v0.01 May 3, 2022

- Grab the input without waiting for "Enter", after a two-second lull.
  This is especially helpful for voice-typing.
- Add "next clue" and "previous clue" commands as variants of "next"
  and "previous" as they are natural instinctive completions.
- Update the documentation a bit.

### Unnumbered tweak, March 20, 2022

- Minor bug-fixes. Remove webifi-version.txt as that mechanism
  is not used any more by Exolve.

### Version: Webifi v0.00 March 20, 2022

- First check-in. This whole thing is still quite experimental.
  The [README.md](README.md) describes the project.
